# Genomic Sequence Clustering and Association Rule Mining

This application allows users to perform genomic sequence clustering using k-means clustering and association rule mining. You can input genomic sequences, extract codons, apply clustering algorithms, and visualize the results.

## Features:
- **Clustering**: Cluster genomic sequences based on codon patterns using k-means clustering.
- **Visualization**: Visualize clusters and association rules using various plotting techniques.
- **Interactive Interface**: Easily interact with the app through user-friendly controls.

## How to Use:
1. **Input a Genomic Sequence**: Enter a genomic sequence (a string of nucleotides) to start the process.
2. **Choose Clustering Parameters**: Select the number of clusters you want to create (e.g., 3 clusters).
3. **View Results**: The app will display the clustered sequences and any association rules found.

## Application Access:
